This package is a modification of the SPH package which implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in
LAMMPS.  Currently, the SPH package has the following features:

* Tait, ideal gas, Lennard-Jones equation of states, full support for 
  complete (i.e. internal-energy dependent) equations of state
* plain or Monaghans XSPH integration of the equations of motion
* density continuity or density summation to propagate the density field
* commands to set internal energy and density of particles from the 
  input script
* output commands to access internal energy and density for dumping and 
  thermo output

The additions to the SPH package by John Savage and Shule Liu are:

* Added atom quantities prtn_conc (proton concentration) and elec_pot (electrostatic potential) plus dprtn_conc 
  This required a change to the atom.cpp and verlet.cpp files also unfortunately and to the form of the .data file.
  Fix_meso has been changed to reflect this, howver fix_meso_stationary hasn't, don't use it.
* Added a pair style, pair_sph_protondiffusion which is based heavily on the pair_sph_heatconduction style. 
  - This style depends on the electrostatic fix to compute the electrostatic potential before the pair computation,
    if one wants the proper physics, but can run without it fine.
  - It uses Ryan's method to propagate proton concentration between water beads.
* Added a compute, compute_meso_prtn_conc_atom, again heavily based on compute_meso_e.
* Added a fix, fix_electrostatic, which computes the electrostatic potential, using a simple scaled coulomb for now.
  I tried implementing Wolf potential but removed it for easier debugging.
  This fix occurs in the PRE_FORCE section of the timestep so adds a second loop over beads.
** THIS WAS AS FAR AS I WAS AT GROUP MEETING **
* Added a pair style pair_sph_nafion, which is for movement of the beads. This is necessary since the equation of state will be more
  complicated that lennard jones or ideal gas, which is all that is in the package currently. This pair style implements the random 
  movement of the Smoothed DPD methodology.
* As it stands, the velocity verlet algorithm is crap for energy and density conservation, so their propagation is turned off.
  We really need to get a better integrating scheme in place. However, as is stands, the simulations run fine with them turned off
  so it's useful for testing.

* Data file is similar to SPH module, except I added prtn_conc column, so it goes like
  atom number, molecule, type, rho, e, cv, prtn_conc, x, y, z
  (Note, as the code is now (Aug '13) e/cv = temperature of simulation, so set cv to be that of water and set e accordingly for desired T)
